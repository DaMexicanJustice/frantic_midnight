## Plan A
Target: [vgsales.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaMexicanJustice/frantic_midnight/master/data%20sets/vgsales.csv)

Source: [Video game sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)


### What is the theme?
* Videogames
* Economics
* Trends

### What does the data set describe?
If we go to the source of the dataset we can see what kind of headers it has and the data it holds.

- 1st header: is the rank on the video game, how popular it is.
- 2nd header: is the name on the video game.
- 3rd header: is the platform the video game is played on.
- 4th header: is the year the video game was made.
- 5th header: is the genre of the video game.
- 6th header: is the publisher of the video game, nintendo, sony etc.
- 7th header: is the number of sales for the game in North America
- 8th header: is the number of sales for the game in Europe
- 9th header: is the number of sales for the game in Japan
- 10th header: is the sales in other countries with that game.
- 11th header: is the global sales, where it basically sums up the sales from USA, EU, JP and Other_sales.


Let's choose which problem we will investigate:

* Which platform is the most popular in the regions NA, EU and Japan?
* How big a share of the global sales does the US sales cover?
* Which game genre is the most popular in 2012?
* Which publisher has the most titles in top 100?
* Which year had the most titles released?
* Which region has the most sales per person?
* Etc? Suggestions?
