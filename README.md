## Plan A
Target: [vgsales.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaMexicanJustice/frantic_midnight/master/data%20sets/vgsales.csv)

Source: [Video game sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)

the dataset we have chosen, is about overall video game sales.<br />
If we go to the source of the dataset we can see what kind of headers it has and the data it holds.

- 1st header: is the rank on the video game, how popular it is.
- 2nd header: is the name on the video game.
- 3rd header: is the platform the video game is played on.
- 4th header: is the year the video game was made.
- 5th header: is the genre of the video game.
- 6th header: is the publisher of the video game, nintendo, sony etc.
- 7th header: is the sales in North America with that video game.
- 8th header: is the sales in Europe with that video game.
- 9th header: is the sales in Japan with that video game.
- 10th header: is the sales in other countries with that game.
- 11th header: is the global sales, where it basically sums up the sales from USA, EU, JP and Other_sales.

What we will investigate are:

* Top 3 most sold genres in USA vs Europe
* Bottom 3 most unpopular genres in USA vs Europe
* Most popular publisher
